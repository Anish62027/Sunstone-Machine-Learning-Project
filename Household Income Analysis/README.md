## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to household demographics and income. It may include attributes such as:
- Household size
- Education level
- Employment status
- Geographic location
- Age of household head
- Total household income

The dataset can be sourced from [insert dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, U.S. Census Bureau].

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Acquiring the dataset from the specified source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distributions and visualizing relationships between features.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze income trends and make predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results
The analysis reveals significant insights into household income trends, such as:
- Key factors affecting income levels: [list significant factors].
- Visualizations demonstrating income distribution and relationships with other demographic variables.
- [Insert any quantitative results, such as percentage increases, key statistics, etc.]
