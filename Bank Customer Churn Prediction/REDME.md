# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
The **Bank Customer Churn Prediction** project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in banking services. The goal is to identify factors contributing to customer attrition, enabling banks to develop targeted strategies for customer retention. The project features a Jupyter Notebook for analysis and a Streamlit application for interactive visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/) and includes information about bank customers with the following features:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Balance
- Number of products
- Has credit card
- Is active member
- Estimated salary
- Exited (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Creating an interactive Streamlit app for real-time prediction.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% (insert your model's accuracy). Key findings from the analysis include:
- Significant features contributing to churn: [list significant features].
- Insights from visualizations illustrating trends in customer behavior.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment for this project.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anish62027/Sunstone-Machine-Learning-Project.git
